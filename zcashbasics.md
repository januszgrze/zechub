# Zcash Basics

## What is Zcash?

Zcash is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol. It is an open-source, blockchain-based ledger that features a sophisticated zero knowledge proving system. Based on Bitcoin's code, it specializes in offering a higher standard of privacy through its proving system preserving confdentiality of transaction metadata. At its core, Zcash is private data ownership that is permissionlessly transferred when transactions are made. 

#### Why does it matter?

Zcash solves Bitcoin's biggest flaw; private ownership and transfer of data. In a world where blockchain applications and cryptocurrencies are becoming more widly accepted, pseudononymous transactions are no longer a viable option to protect user privacy. Surveillance applications are becoming more widely used to analyze blockchain transactions.

## What is ZEC?

ZEC is a digital currency that is based on the Zcash blockchain. It is the closest approximation to cash on the web. While it shares many similar features to bitcoin, it solves bitcoin's biggest flaw by enabling users to run fully private monetary transactions.

#### Why is a private currency important?

ZEC gives people the opportunity to transfer data permissionlessly. Having a peer-to-peer, permissionless money system gives people the ability to store wealth, or transact with others, independent of centralized entities. ZEC also helps people choose when they want to disclose information about their finances with others.

## ZEC Use Cases

#### Payments

People use ZEC to transact efficiently and safely with low fees. Shielded Zcash ensures transactions remain confidential, while also giving them the option to share address and transaction information should they choose to. Private, "Z-Z" transactions appear on the public blockchain so it is known that they occured and that fees were paid. But, the addresses, transaction amount and memo field are all encrypted and not publicly visible. 

#### Store of Value

People can also use ZEC to store wealth in a hard, privacy protecting, asset. There will only ever be 21 million ZEC units, meaning that the asset has a fixed supply. Once the 21 millionth ZEC is [mined into circulation](https://z.cash/mining-zcash/), the asset will become anti-inflationary. Anti-inflationary assets are a good hedge against inflation in the event that centralized gatekeepers inflate national money supplies.

#### Messaging

People can use the memo field in a shielded Z-Z transaction to send fully encrypted messages. To send a memo, users must run a transaction and pay a transaction fee, which is less than $0.01.
